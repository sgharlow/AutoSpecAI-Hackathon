?? Project Title: AutoSpec.AI
Smart Document-to-System Requirements Analyzer

?? Project Summary
AutoSpec.AI is a serverless application that enables users to email or upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and receive structured, AI-generated system requirements using a Bedrock-powered prompt that mimics the mindset of a skilled systems analyst. The output includes functional requirements, non-functional requirements, stakeholder roles, and technical transparency in both narrative and tabular format.

?? System Design Overview
Core Functionalities:
1. Receive document input (via email or API upload).
2. Store document in S3.
3. Trigger Lambda function on new upload.
4. Parse document (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
5. Call Amazon Bedrock with a well-crafted prompt.
6. Format AI response into structured system requirements (Markdown, JSON, optionally PDF).
7. Send result back via email (SES) or Slack webhook.
8. Save input/output history in DynamoDB with metadata for version tracking.

?? Development Plan
Week 1: Core Functionality MVP
Day 1-2: Environment Setup
* Initialize GitHub repo with CDK or SAM template.
* Set up S3, SES (verified email), API Gateway (optional), IAM roles.
Day 3-4: Lambda: Document Ingestion
* SES inbound rule ? Lambda trigger.
* S3 upload handler Lambda to log metadata and route to processing.
Day 5-6: Lambda: AI Processing
* Format document content.
* Send to Amazon Bedrock with system analysis prompt.
* Capture Bedrock response (raw and structured).
Day 7: Lambda: Output Generation + Return
* Structure output: Markdown + JSON.
* Send response via SES.
* Store record in DynamoDB with original file + response hash.

Week 2: Polish and Enhance
Day 8-9: Slack Integration (optional path)
* Add support for receiving/responding via Slack slash command or webhook.
Day 10: Output Formatting
* Convert response to downloadable PDF (using Lambda+Layer or prebuilt utility).
* Add summary chart/table formatting.
Day 11: API Gateway (alternate input)
* Support RESTful upload of file ? same Lambda workflow.
Day 12: Logging + Monitoring
* Add detailed logging (CloudWatch) and metrics for throughput/error rate.
Day 13: README + Deployment Script
* Add instructions for self-deploy.
* Include architecture diagram and Lambda flow explanation.
Day 14: Record 3-minute demo video
* Show full flow: email in ? Bedrock ? structured AI response.

?? Optional Future Enhancements (If Time Permits)
FeatureDescriptionWeb UISimple UI to upload document and retrieve responseOAuthEmail verification + upload access controlDocument DiffCompare new vs old requirements (versioning)Multi-model AIOffer comparison between Claude, Titan, and Jurassic responsesFine-tuned promptsSelect from different requirement formats (Agile user stories, Use Cases, etc.)Batch inputAccept multiple documents in zip and return consolidated resultsFeedback loopAllow users to rate output quality and fine-tune prompts accordingly
?? Prompt for Bedrock
Review this document with the mindset of a skilled systems analyst and break down the contents into an organized list of system requirements that meet these criteria:
1. Comprehensive and Clear Structure  
2. Depth and Clarity of Functional Requirements  
3. Role-Specific Responsibilities  
4. Technical Transparency  
5. Non-Functional Requirements Are Not Forgotten  
6. Cross-Referencing and Version Control  
7. Balanced Use of Narrative and Tabular Format  
Return your output in structured Markdown with headings for each requirement category.
