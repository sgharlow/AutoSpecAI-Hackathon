### Requirements Structure

AutoSpec.AI extracts requirements in a structured format:

#### Functional Requirements

Requirements that describe what the system should do:

```json
{
  "id": "FR-001",
  "title": "User Authentication",
  "description": "The system shall authenticate users via email and password",
  "priority": "High",
  "category": "Security",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "User can log in with valid credentials",
    "Invalid credentials are rejected",
    "Account lockout after 3 failed attempts"
  ]
}
```

#### Non-Functional Requirements

Requirements that describe how the system should perform:

```json
{
  "id": "NFR-001",
  "title": "Response Time",
  "description": "The system shall respond to user requests within 2 seconds",
  "type": "Performance",
  "metric": "Response time < 2 seconds",
  "priority": "Medium"
}
```

#### Stakeholder Roles
